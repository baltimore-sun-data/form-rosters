# form-rosters
This repository will be a holding area for form rosters in the Mid-Atlantic region.

A form roster is a document that tracks the forms maintained by a police department, sheriff's office or other policing organization. It can be extremely useful for both journalists and citizen activists, as it allows the public to see what information a law-enforcement organization tracks. This, in turn, can facilitate more efficient information requests.

The Sun newsroom has received more than two dozen of these rosters from policing organizations, and we eventually plan to post most of them for public use, once we've had time to do some basic cleaning -- conversion of any proprietary formats, basic virus checking, etc.,. 

For now, we're starting out with a few documents. Please keep an eye on this repository: We'll be putting more up over the coming months.
